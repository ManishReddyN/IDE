# Code Runner

Welcome to the **Code Runner** repository! This project allows users to execute code online directly from the browser. It includes additional features for sharing code execution results via generated shortlinks.

## Purpose

- Writing and executing code on the web.
- Sharing code snippets and their respective input/output via shortlinks.
- Supporting a user-friendly development environment, complemented with a Node.js backend.

## Features
- **Online Code Execution**: Compile and run code seamlessly within the web interface.
- **Shortlink Generation**: Easily share code, input, and output with others via uniquely generated shortlinks.
- **Modern Frontend**: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Powerful Backend**: Node.js powers the backend for handling requests and code execution.
